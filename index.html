			<p>This simple <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Telegram-API-</a>based bot was developed as a part of my term project for "Programming basics for data science" course at HSE. There are <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples">several telegram-API libraries</a>  already written for this purpose  </p>
		<h2>What can this bot do?</h2>
			<p>After receiving a url, the bot sends a user statistics on the site text. It includes word, sentences count, readability index and top-10 frequent words.</p>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p>The bot listens (long polling) to https://api.telegram.org/bot_token_/getUpdates. Users messages appear there as json-objects. After receiving an update the Bot handles it as an Upd-class object. From this object the Bot exctracts conversation address and message text (potentially containing the link, a user wants to explore). The Bot looks for a http(s)-link in the message. If there is no link, the Bot ignores such a message. If a link is found, it is redirected to the Scraper. The Scraper scrapes text from the website (currently from p-tags only). If it fails to do so, the user receives a message with information about an occured error. If the text has been scrapped successfully, it's passed to the Analyzer. It counts words, sentences and characters and some other text stats.</p>

			<p>All the received Updates are stored in the "contents" folder. All Bot-methods calls are logged in the log.log file by logger function.<p>
