# Telegram Bot
This simple Telegram-API based bot was developed as a part of my term project for "Programming basics for data science" course at HSE.
There are several telegram-API libraries already written for this purpose https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples. 
Howerver, no such libraries were used in this projects, because of its educational purpose.
## What can this bot do?
After receiving a url, the bot sends a user statistics on the site text.
It includes word, sentences count, readability index and top-10 frequent words.
## How does it work?
